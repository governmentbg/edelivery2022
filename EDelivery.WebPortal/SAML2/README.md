### Where to get it

Run the following command in the NuGet Package Manager console to install the library:

    PM> Install-Package SAML2

### Usage & Examples

### Credits

As this library is a fork of [OIOSAML.NET](https://digitaliser.dk/group/42063/resources), much of the credit goes to them.

Changes from OIOSAML.NET include:
* NuGet package availability.
* More general namespacing.
* Addition of NameIDFormat support.
* Addition of RequestedAuthnContext support.
* Abstraction of logging to providers to eliminate hard dependency on Log4Net.
* Elimination of Trace usage in favor of abstracted logging providers.
* Expanded logging capabilities
* Abstraction of assertion validation into profiles that allow for custom extensions to the SAML spec requirements without needing include arbitrary implementations in the main library (e.g. Danish Government profile, eGov profile, etc.).
* Completely revamped configuration sections
* Ability to auto-download identity provider metadata files at application start time with the [Metadata Fetcher Module](Metadata Fetcher Module)
